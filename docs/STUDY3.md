# Study 3 (Theory Validation Applications) Images

Our system generates multiple sets of product images with controlled levels of focal variable, addressing  limited and narrowly defined image set in the original studies. By varying only focal feature while keeping other features constant, more systematic testing of how these feature affect consumer perception can be achieved.
